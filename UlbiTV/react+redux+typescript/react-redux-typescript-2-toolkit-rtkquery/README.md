# React+redux toolkit+RTK query+typescript+ training course.
In this application, we request a list of users and a list of to-dos from the server and display them on the page. When displaying a to-do list, we developed a pagination functionality that, when moving to another page, will load the contents of that page. When loading data, three states are implemented: sending a request (waiting), successful receiving data, and unsuccessful loading data. The main focus when creating this application was on learning typescript in react.
