# React+redux toolkit+RTK query+typescript+ training course.
Part 1. Working with synchronous code. Creating a counterSlice.

Part 2. Working with asynchronous code. Requests to the JSON placeholder server to get users. Creating a userSlice using extraReducers, using the createAsyncThunk function to create an async action user/fetchAll.

Part 3. Working with the RTK Query library. Creating an endpoint for receiving posts from the JSON Placeholder server. Familiarization with the functionality of the library: refetch, pollingInterval. Working with auto-generated hooks (useFetchAllPostsQuery).

Part 4. Working with the RTK Query library and the JSON Server - a fake REST API. Creating endpoints for creating a new post, changing a post and deleting it. Working with auto-generated hooks (useCreatePostMutation, useUpdatePostMutation, useDeletePostMutation).
